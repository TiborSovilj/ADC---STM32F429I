# ADC---STM32F429I
Testing ADC on STM32F429I with aditional potentiometer and LED display bar

Application uses external potetntiometer which is used to regulate input voltage (0-3.3V), converts it to digital using 10-bit ADC on STM32F429I Discovery board, then indicates it on external LED display bar. IDE: IAR Workbench
